# genos CV

Based on [`cv-boilerplate`](https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate).

A boilerplate to ease the pain of building and maintaining a CV or résumé using LaTeX.

## Dependencies

1. LaTeX with the following packages: `fontspec`, `geometry`, `hyperref`, `marginnote`, `sectsty`, `setspace`, `tabu`, `ulem`, `xltxtra`, `xunicode`
2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal document converter.

## Available settings

- **`mainfont`**: Every font installed on your system should work out of the box (thanks, XeTeX!)
- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.
- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.

## Resources

- Refer to [pandoc's documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) to learn more about how templates work.
- If you're not familiar with the YAML syntax, [here](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)'s a good overview.
- If you want to edit the template but LaTeX scares you, these [docs](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Main_Page) put together by ShareLaTeX cover most of the basics and are surprisingly kind to the beginner.
- Odds are your question already has an answer on [TeX Stack Exchange](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Main_Page). Also, pretty friendly crowd in there.
